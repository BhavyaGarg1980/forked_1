Not all of the monadic types are in this section, but most of them 
are.  The other monadic types are [the collections](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Immutable%20Collections/index.html), and the
[effect-system monads of `IO`, `Eff`, `StreamT`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Core/Effects/index.html), 
and [`Pipes`](https://louthy.github.io/language-ext/LanguageExt.Pipes/index.html)
