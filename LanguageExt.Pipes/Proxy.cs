/// A `Proxy` is a monad transformer that receives and sends information on both
/// an upstream and downstream interface.  It is the base type for all of the key
/// other important types in the Pipes ecosystem, like `Producer`, `Consumer`,
/// `Pipe`, etc.
/// 
/// Diagrammatically, you can think of a `Proxy` as having the following shape:
/// 
///         Upstream | Downstream
///             +---------+
///             |         |
///       UOut ◄--       ◄-- DIn
///             |         |
///       UIn  --►       --► DOut
///             |    |    |
///             +----|----+
///                  A
///
/// You can connect proxies together in five different ways:
/// 
///   1. Connect pull-based streams
///   2. Connect push-based streams
///   3. Chain folds
///   4. Chain unfolds
///   5. Sequence proxies
/// 
/// The type variables signify:
///
/// * `UOut` and `Uin` - The upstream interface, where `UOut` go out and `UIn` come in
/// * `DOut` and `DIn` - The downstream interface, where `DOut` go out and `DIn` come in
/// * `RT` - The runtime of the transformed effect monad
/// * `A` - The return value
